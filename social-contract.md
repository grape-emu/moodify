<h2>Group Grape Emu Norms</h2>

- flexible on individual night/weekend work, organized by tasks more than time
- will check slack before bed, after waking up (but not constantly)
- final final commit by 6pm the night before it's due
- will use travis, heroku: all keys in secrets.js (in gitignore)
- mutual respect
- commit messages professional, clean -- semantic commit messages, esp for PRs
- PRs no commented out code, no console logs
- filename conventions: CapCamelCase for React Components, dashes for rest of front end (redux and public/html-css), camelCase for back end
- veto, not majority
- no one approves their own PR, but partners can approve
- approve PRs closely
- generalize until mvp, then don't worry about specializing
- Materials UI
- if user login: privacy policy, gdpr, etc
